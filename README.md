# TreeSortedStack
Final project for Data Structures course.
---
The goal of this project was to create a ADT (abstract data structure) called a *sorted stack*. It was implemented using a dynamically allocated array in memory, and took the shape of a binary tree. This structure, which was designed to store integers, had the following properties:
* Every node must be smaller than its children
* We must be able to represent the tree as an array without any gaps in it

Related to this ADT were some methods created to perform operations such as push, pop, peek (similar to pop but the data does not get deleted), getting the size and checking if it was empty.
